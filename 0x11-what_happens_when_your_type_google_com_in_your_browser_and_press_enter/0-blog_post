In today's digitally connected world, web browsing has become an integral part of our everyday lives. When we type a URL like https://www.google.com into our browser and press Enter, several processes are set in motion behind the scenes to facilitate the display of the requested website. First, the browser sends a DNS request to the Domain Name System server. The DNS server responds by providing the IP address associated with the domain name "www.google.com".
The TCP/IP protocol is then used to establish a connection between the browser and the server hosting the website. This protocol ensures reliable transmission of data by breaking it into smaller packets, sending them over the internet, and reassembling them at the destination. Next, the data packets pass through any firewalls that may be in place. Firewalls are security measures that monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic. HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer) comes into play to secure the data transmission between the browser and the server by encrypting the data. The use of HTTPS/SSL ensures that the information exchanged between the browser and the server remains private and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by malicious actors. After passing through the firewall and establishing a secure connection, the request arrives at the load-balancer. Then reach to web or application server.
